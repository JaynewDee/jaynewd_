        The Project Beneath
      </h3>

      <p>
        This web application, in addition to being a place to display
        programming projects and other creative accomplishments, is itself a
        personal project and the largest codebase I have built to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build the majority of projects with a strong focus on efficiency and
        utility, in both code quality and use case, but I took the liberty with
        this portfolio application to freely explore vague ideas without
        hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The codebase reflects this approach, as it is messy and attempts to be
        many things, falling short of most of them. But I do feel that I
        succeeded at my original objective: to journey wherever my curiousity
        might take me and absorb the resulting lessons, many of which
        communicate a clear "what not to do".
