      <h3>Hello, human!</h3>
      <p>
        While conceiving this interactive portfolio project, I had no central
        vision of the end result, but rather, I felt my heart emboldened toward
        3 primary endeavors:
      </p>
      <section className="section">
        <h3>Ethos</h3>
        <p>
          The distillation and expression of that which provides meaning and
          warmth to my life.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
          The demonstration of my love for programming by sharing, however
          flawed, the programs I have built or helped to build.
        </p>
        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>
          Some novelties that were never realized beyond the joy they were to
          make.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        If the eye is a portal between the phenomenal world and the human mind,
        may this site be a portal between your world and mine.
      </p>
      <p>Best always,</p>
      <br />
