        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
          The demonstration of my love for programming by sharing, however
          flawed, the programs I have built or helped to build.
        </p>
        <h3>Ethos</h3>
        <p>
          The distillation and expression of a conceptual framework which
          provides meaning and warmth to my life.
        </p>
        <h3>etc.</h3>
        <p>
          Some novelties that were never realized beyond the joy they were to
          make.

        If the eye is a portal between the phenomenal world and the human mind,
