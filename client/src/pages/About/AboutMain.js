      <h3>Hello, human!</h3>

        While conceiving to build this interactive portfolio project, I had no
        central vision of the end result, but rather, I felt my heart emboldened
        toward 3 primary endeavors:
      </p>
      <section className="section">
        <h3>Ethos</h3>
        <p>
          The distillation and expression of that ideological paradigm which provides vitality
          and meaning to my daily life.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>The demonstration of my love for programming by sharing, however flawed, the programs I have built or helped to build.</p>
        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p></p>
      </section>
      <section className="section">
        <p>
          The development process was awkward and unorganized. The willful
          blindness that inspired it reveals itself in the final shape of the
          code: messy and excited, clueless and determined, but above all: essentially playful.

        <p>I am honored by you if you've read this far.</p>

          Synthetic rain is my joyful attempt to marry the decisive power of
          technology to a natural symbol, a lurch toward capturing metaphorically
          the pervasive modern juxtaposition of machine and flesh. That though we often
          stare through electrons painting raining arrays of pixels with rays of light,
          there is always a human behind the screen.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>If the eye is a portal between the phenomenal world and the human mind, may this site be a portal between your world and mine.</p>
      <p>Best always,</p>
      <br />
