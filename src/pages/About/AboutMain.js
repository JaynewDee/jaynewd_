       <p>Synthetic rain is my happy attempt to marry the decisive power of technology to a natural symbol, a lurch toward capturing metaphorically the pervasive modern juxtaposition of machine and flesh.
       </p>
       <p>While building this interactive portfolio project, I felt my heart emboldened toward 3 primary endeavors:
       </p>
         <ul>
            <li>  A succinct sketch of that ideological paradigm which provides vitality and meaning to my daily life </li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
         </ul> 
      
       <p>I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
       <p>Best always,</p>
       <br />
